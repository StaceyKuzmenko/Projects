# Projects

This repository is intended for data analytics projects that I carried out as part of my training at Yandex.Practicum, and as well as my pet-projects from Keggle.
These projects are created in the Python programming language using data analysis libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SkLearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly). The works are designed in Jupiter Notebook using Anaconda as a means of connection.

## Project 1: A/B-testing

In this project:
* I prioritized hypotheses using the ICE and RICE frameworks,
* I ran an A/B test (having previously assessed the quality of the available data, namely: the "division" of traffic, the number of users in groups A and B, etc.) and analyzed the results obtained.

I have been evaluated:
- cumulative revenue by group
- cumulative average check by group
- cumulative conversion by group
- relative change in cumulative conversion of group B to group A
- 95th and 99th percentile of the cost of orders (to determine the boundary of abnormal orders and select the level of statistical significance of the alpha coefficient test)
The A/B test in this paper was a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, both for "raw" data and for "purified" data. I checked the statistical significance of the difference in the average order receipt between groups, as well as the difference in conversion between groups.



## Project 2: Analysis of business indicators

I was provided with a dataset of an Internet application with server logs about visits, purchases by new users for a certain period. I was also provided with statistics of advertising expenses on various platforms. 

In the process of writing the project, I analyzed how people use the product, when they start buying, how much money each client brings, when it pays off and what factors negatively affect user engagement. 

To solve the tasks set:
- I wrote a function to create user profiles, on which I based the cohort analysis;
- I wrote the calculation and analysis functions of LTV, ROI, CAC, retention and conversion;
- I evaluated the overall payback of advertising, as well as separately: by platforms, channels of attraction, countries;
At the end of the work done, I formed recommendations for the advertising department.



## Project 3: Consumer Behavior Research (A/A/B-testing)

In this project, I investigated the consumer behavior of customers of a mobile application that sells food. Before the test, I analyzed the funnel of events in the application (how many users reach the purchase, how many â€“ "slows down" in the previous steps). 
Next, I conducted a preliminary check of the data before testing: the number of users in different groups, the correctness of traffic division. The users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control and 1 experimental. It was necessary to test the hypothesis of equality of A/B test samples separately for each event in the application. The samples were checked in pairs by means of a z-test. Then I repeated the same thing, taking into account the Bonferroni correction (to reduce the group probability of a first-kind error).
